# Intro to Functional Programming

## Pedagogy

To learn functional programming patterns I believe it's best to examine several concrete examples of patterns from several different angles to completely understand the it. Then once the pattern is undestood, abstract it. This approach is best described by Brent Yorgey [here](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/), and it's the approach I use to teach.
